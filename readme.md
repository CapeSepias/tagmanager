Tag Manager
===========

Tags are great, they are literally the best way we have of indicating what a piece of content is, what itâ€™s about and
where it came from. We use tags to generate navigation on theguardian.com and provide pages and pages of links to
interesting content. Tags can be mapped which allows them to magically show rich contextual information from external
systems on relevant pages. Everyone loves tags.

The tag manager allows the tags to be ... er ... managed
 
Running

The Nginx setup uses the [dev-nginx](https://github.com/guardian/dev-nginx) tool. after running this the tag manager
